# Project Title: Loan Sanction Prediction Using Decision Tree

Description:

The "Loan Sanction Prediction Using Decision Tree" project is a data-driven initiative designed to assist financial institutions in automating and enhancing their loan approval processes. This project leverages decision tree algorithms to predict whether a loan application should be sanctioned or denied based on a set of predefined criteria.

### Project Objectives:

Automated Decision-Making: The primary goal of this project is to create a predictive model that can make automated loan sanction decisions, reducing the need for manual intervention and speeding up the loan approval process.

Risk Assessment: The decision tree model evaluates the risk associated with each loan application by considering various factors, such as applicant credit history, income, loan amount, and more. This allows financial institutions to minimize the risk of non-performing loans.

Efficiency and Consistency: By using a decision tree, the project ensures consistent and transparent decision-making, reducing the potential for human bias and errors in loan approvals.

Improved Customer Experience: Faster and more predictable loan approval decisions can lead to an improved customer experience, as applicants receive quicker responses.

Customization: The decision tree model can be customized to accommodate specific lending criteria and policies of different financial institutions, making it adaptable to a variety of scenarios.

### Key Steps:

Data Collection: Gather historical loan application data, including applicant information, credit scores, employment history, and loan outcomes (approved or denied).

Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and ensure data quality.

Feature Selection: Identify the most relevant features that influence loan sanction decisions, which will be used in the decision tree model.

Model Building: Train a decision tree classifier using the preprocessed data to create a predictive model for loan sanction decisions.

Model Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Fine-tune the model if necessary.

Input for one-person prediction.
